              <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Well, I’ve tested this engine and this is the most flawessly that all others source ports (Berserker 3, iouake 3, OpenArena, etc).</p>
<p>Finally, a source port that correct’s the <strong>Aspect correct wide screen FOV and HUD in Q3A!</strong></p>
<p>However, I like to use some of more of FOV (cg_fov 100), and when I do this, the Weapon HUD still begin to streching.</p>
<p>The maner that I fix this, is changin the values of 3 variables:</p>
<p>cg_gunx,<br>
cg_guny<br>
cg_gunz</p>
<p>Sadly, I don’t know why, the developers block this variables with the “Cheat Protected” restriction.</p>
<p>In this same way, ioquake (Spearmint too), blocks a newer variables that correspond with the graphics part, I mean:</p>
<p>r_forcesun<br>
r_ambientscale</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why the developer block this variables if this variables are really AWESOME!</p>
<p>The only way to play with this variables is through <strong><em>devmap</em></strong> command, but is not the optimus way to probe this engine.</p>
<p>Well, resuming, there’s a way to unlock the following variables? (compiling a new engine, modifing the current Spearmint engine, etc):</p>
<p><strong>OLD VARIABLES</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Graphics Part</strong></em><br>
seta r_znear<br>
seta r_lodcurveerror</p>
<p><strong><em>HUD Part</em></strong><br>
cg_gunx<br>
cg_guny<br>
cg_gunz</p>
<p><strong>NEWER VARIABLES (ONLY IN SPEARMINT)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Graphics Part</strong></em><br>
r_forcesun<br>
r_ambientscale</p>
<p>Well, I hope that changing this aspect of this engine may be possible.</p>
<p>See ya!</p>

              <p>Hello! I’m checking out Spearmint Q3A as an option for a splitscreen LAN party thingy. I intend to pitch this game as something to play instead of our usual fallback, Halo: Reach, but something that has me concerned is the lack of camera adhesion or aim assist for controllers, as I don’t think my friends would be willing to play without that crutch. Is there a way to enable it, even if it is something of a weird hack? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>For thoose who wonder why to use Discord I’ll say that it’s runs so fast! Skype is full of ads, lags, spy things.<br>
Currently soon screensharing will be added in Discord, but what I wait it’s VIDEO call, so it beat skype out completely.<br>
Well, just check the official site of Discord. And it’s crossplatform.</p>

              <p>I’ve got the cvar already ready, it’s called “ui_demoq3test” &amp; it will include the menu text featured in the demotest as well as the load/save config menus. Otherwise, it will function similarly to the demo. Also, an option to load the demo ending cutscene was also implemented. I know other things need to be done before it will look exactly like the original, but I think this may help make it take shape cosmetically &amp; functionally. Just how are you supposed to make menu options disappear using a cvar anyway? Mind helping me out here anyone?</p>

              <p>I ported the botlib (except the C preprocessor which is also used by Team Arena CGame/UI) into the Game VM. This required the ability to free memory, which was added in Spearmint devil branch and released in Spearmint 0.4. See <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/tree/botlib">botlib branch</a>.</p>
<p>I’m planning to move files I had previously ported to Game VM back into the botlib. The main reason I’m holding off merging it into master branch is because BSPC requires parts of the botlib in the engine.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/tree/botlib">bspc branch</a> with it ported to mint-arena based on the botlib branch but it require a bunch of engine code, including BSP and ZIP loading and the C preprocessor, to be duplicated. <img src="//forum.clover.moe/images/emoji/twitter/weary.png?v=5" title=":weary:" class="emoji" alt=":weary:"></p>
<p>So I’m still working through how to handle this, but it will happen eventually.</p>

              <p>I’m currently trying to add an additional bot skill to Quake 3. It’ll be “You Will Never Win!” mode, where everyone’s bot skill is maxed out. I’m having trouble figuring out where exactly the code for the bot skills lay. I’ve already done the UI for the new bot skill, it just needs a new sound/skill image. Mind helping me out with this, guys?</p>

              <p>This bug exists in ioq3 &amp; classic Q3 as well. The bug is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start a TDM on any map (I used q3dm7)</li>
<li>Have at least one person on both teams (I tested with at least 4 bots on Blue &amp; 1 on Red)</li>
<li>Have everyone on your team kill the only bot on Red (might also happen with just one teammate, untested however)</li>
<li>If you didn’t give these teammates a new order, after a while, “ERROR: PlayerName: player name out of range” or similar will occur. Bug happens on Q3 1.32c &amp; possibly even the original source code has this bug. Unknown if the bug happens on earlier versions of Q3. Mind fixing this (&amp; the stuck in RA room q3dm7 issue) before Spearmint 0.4 if possible <a class="mention" href="/u/zturtleman">@zturtleman</a>? Thanks in advance.</li>

              <p>I’m going to try to fix the <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/issues/248">activate entity regression on nodm7</a> over the weekend and publish the new Spearmint 0.4 release on July 13 2016.</p>
<p>I’m tried of waiting for August to get here. I’d like to just do the release and move on. Also, ioq3 merged a pull request that removes Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 support, which I don’t want to merge into Spearmint right now or deal with “fixing it”.</p>
<p>I’m planning to release a new version of Turtle Arena in August. That’s the only reason Spearmint 0.4 got moved from January 13 2017 (a Friday the 13th) to August 13 2016. Moving Spearmint to July might also make it easier to focus on Turtle Arena.</p>

<p>I have both Q3A and Team Arena on Steam. Q3 has all the pk3 required for spearmint to run (0-8) but my missionpack folder only has pak0.pk3, and the readme says it needs 0-4. Team Arena works fine native from Steam, though.</p>

              <p>I was wanting to use it because I wanted to make a green team mod &amp; a new 3-way CTF gametype for it, but it turns out quite a bit of g_team.c &amp; ai_team.c would have to be rewritten because of this…<br>
Currently, the only 2 possible values for the friendly/enemy team would be TEAM_RED &amp; TEAM_BLUE, I would like those to be TEAM_FRIENDLY, TEAM_ENEMY1, &amp; TEAM_ENEMY2 for this gametype to be possible… Those values should be wildcards, and should be controlled by which teams are in the map, for ex. Blue &amp; Red are at it again in 2-way CTF, TEAM_FRIENDLY would be the team that the bots/humans are on (on the Blue Team’s case, it would be TEAM_BLUE, &amp; for the Red Team, it would be TEAM_RED. TEAM_ENEMY1 would be the opposite team (opposite values than TEAM_FRIENDLY), &amp; TEAM_ENEMY2 would be set to no team, since there’s only 2 teams in that CTF. This configuration would allow you to select more than the blue/red team in 2-team CTF, &amp; all 3 teams in 3-team CTF. I know what you’re thinking <a class="mention" href="/u/zturtleman">@zturtleman</a>, it’s a bit unorthodox to have 3 teams in CTF, isn’t it? TEAM_FRIENDLY would in this case depend on whichever team you selected/whatever bots were selected to go there. Same with TEAM_ENEMY1 &amp; TEAM_ENEMY2. Gameplay’s the same, except this time, there are 2 enemies of your team instead of one, &amp; if you grab both teams’ flags, you earn 2 captures for your team because you captured 2 flags.<br>
Green team is possible because there is a green team skin pk3 which is downloadable via <a href="http://ws.q3df.org" rel="nofollow noopener">ws.q3df.org</a>.<br>
Hope I’m not tiring you out, <a class="mention" href="/u/zturtleman">@zturtleman</a>…</p>

              <p>I’ve disabled the issue tracker because it’s not used as one. I generally only created issues for stuff I planned to do, not actual issues. I don’t like it being a request list either. Also, having the main repo page just show “Issues (66)” etc always bothered me as most are for enhancement – not that the engine is broken as hell.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>Did you play Spearmint with friends in splitscreen mode? Well, if you did, and own a monitor with a ‘modern’ aspect ration e.g.: 16:10 or 16:9, you probably might noticed that something feels a bit ‘wrong’, especially if you have only two splitscreen players.<br>
What has worked well in the past (remembering games like Need for Speed etc.), feels a bit weird on modern monitors. To make a long stroy short, my friends and I had some real troubles to get used to all those modern, and therefore better <img src="//forum.clover.moe/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=5" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> monitor aspect ratios.<br>
At first we tried the usual procedure: tweaking the cg_fov value (you can open your game console and type cg_fov 80 for example). This doesn’t help much, so we tried a new cvar, new to Spearmint, called cg_fovAspectAdjust.<br>
Tweaking both, will improve splitscreen gaming experience. Though, really satisfied was none of us, the problem still remains, because the problem is the monitor, and not the game.<br>
So after many hours, as a last resort, since we can’t switch back to old monitors (4:3), we decided to use the third option we can try: Vertical splitscreen!<br>
Wow! To our surprise, after some time to get used to it, most of us liked it more to play with verticall splitcreen than with horizontal splitscreen. Yes, you will need some time, to get used to it, probably you will never get used to it, but certainly for a few players, this will be the feature they were looking for.<br>
Try it! You can set vertical splitscreen play via q3 menu -&gt;Setup-&gt;Game Options or via your game console: cg_splitviewVertical 1.<br>
Of course, the wider the monitors aspect ratio is, the more likely vertical splitscreen play will be your choice. Additionally vertical view will reduce the stretching (distorsion) of your view (depending on your cg_fov settings). Some short, basic info about FOV in games: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view_in_video_games" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_of_view_in_video_games</a></p>
<p>Well, what I wonder is what other players setting are, concerning the FOV variables (cg_fov, cg_fovAspectAdjust, and cg_splitviewVertical)? What are your setting?<br>
In contrast to most articles, and probably most players, personally I prefer narrower FOV settings on monitors with a 16:9 ratio, can’t explain exactly why, but aiming gets better… <img src="//forum.clover.moe/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

              <p>When I made a new botfile for q3dm7 using forcesidesvisible, it actually fixes (or made almost unnoticeable) the stuck in RA room issue. Although in it, they take the jump pad to the shotgun multiple times. Otherwise, they’re fine. <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/issues/260" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/issues/260</a> happens to have a link to it, so if you wanna test that, go ahead.</p>
