    <title>Botlib in Game VM</title>
    <link>https://forum.clover.moe/t/botlib-in-game-vm/58</link>
    <description>I ported the botlib (except the C preprocessor which is also used by Team Arena CGame/UI) into the Game VM. This required the ability to free memory, which was added in Spearmint devil branch and released in Spearmint 0.4. See [botlib branch](https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/tree/botlib).

I&#39;m planning to move files I had previously ported to Game VM back into the botlib. The main reason I&#39;m holding off merging it into master branch is because BSPC requires parts of the botlib in the engine.

I have a [bspc branch](https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/tree/botlib) with it ported to mint-arena based on the botlib branch but it require a bunch of engine code, including BSP and ZIP loading and the C preprocessor, to be duplicated. :weary:

So I&#39;m still working through how to handle this, but it will happen eventually.</description>

Sorry, I’m an idiot, I better continue playing chess instead of talking about programming like a pro!<br>
Anyways, thanks for the clarification!</p>
<p>Do you plan to provide RtCW’s AAS worlds in Spearmint engine? For me it’s hard to do this even now! Not to think about that when be_aas_routetable.c will be in game vm! <img src="//forum.clover.moe/images/emoji/twitter/worried.png?v=5" title=":worried:" class="emoji" alt=":worried:"></p>

<p>trap_HeapFree does not affect renderer never freeing models, images, and skin surfaces.</p>

              <p>To be honest, I can’t really help you with all this! Currently I also struggling with serious AI (botlib) problems.<br>
So, just a few thoughts:</p>
<p>What I wonder is how the new memory system affects mint-iortcw (AAS Routing)? Maybe I do understand everything wrong, but doesn’t <strong>‘trap_HeapMalloc’</strong> replace’  <strong>‘trap_Alloc’</strong>, which in turn replaced <strong>‘GetClearedMemory’</strong> as a similiar function?<br>
Does this mean that the routing table (be_aas_routetable.c) will also move into game? Or is this a completely different story? I think the routing table is also using <strong>‘AAS_RT_GetClearedMemory’</strong>!</p>
<p>Well, I assume you know some reasons why it was better to move lot of botlib code into game. For low-skilled programmers like me it’s nearly impossible to understand your code changes. Sometimes I wish the moved AI code back into botlib! But this is only due to lack of skill on my side…, so, I bet you will find a good solution!</p>
<p>Could this freeing of memory also be used to fix the old idtech3 bug where a crash happens if lot of bots/models are removed and another bunch of new bots/models are added afterwards? I think you know what bug I’m talking about (we talked about that bug a long time ago).<br>
You know, if you have many different player models and remove them (e.g.: by a kickall command) and load another bunch of bots with different models the game will crash because assets (skins/textures/sounds) aren’t removed from memory.<br>
Will using <strong>‘trap_HeapFree’</strong> fix this idtech3 bug?</p>
