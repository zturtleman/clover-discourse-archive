    <title>Team_model should also change team_headmodel like what model does with headmodel</title>

    <description>I always found it annoying that you had to set both team_model &amp; team_headmodel when setting your player model. model &amp; headmodel do this, so it only seems right to do it with team_model as well... Do you agree, @zturtleman?</description>

              <p>Yeah, there isn’t really a reason that there is not a team_model command that also sets team_headmodel. In Turtle Arena I made blank [team_]headmodel use value from [team_]model, but adding a command like Q3’s model command probably fit better (especially in Team Arena as it sets team_headmodel in regular use).</p>
