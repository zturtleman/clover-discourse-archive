    <title>Found a bug with Spearmint</title>
    <link>https://forum.clover.moe/t/found-a-bug-with-spearmint/54</link>
    <description>This bug exists in ioq3 &amp; classic Q3 as well. The bug is as follows:
1. Start a TDM on any map (I used q3dm7)
2. Have at least one person on both teams (I tested with at least 4 bots on Blue &amp; 1 on Red)
3. Have everyone on your team kill the only bot on Red (might also happen with just one teammate, untested however)
4. If you didn&#39;t give these teammates a new order, after a while, &quot;ERROR: PlayerName: player name out of range&quot; or similar will occur. Bug happens on Q3 1.32c &amp; possibly even the original source code has this bug. Unknown if the bug happens on earlier versions of Q3. Mind fixing this (&amp; the stuck in RA room q3dm7 issue) before Spearmint 0.4 if possible @zturtleman? Thanks in advance.</description>
