        <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Well, I‚Äôve tested this engine and this is the most flawessly that all others source ports (Berserker 3, iouake 3, OpenArena, etc).</p>
<p>Finally, a source port that correct‚Äôs the <strong>Aspect correct wide screen FOV and HUD in Q3A!</strong></p>
<p>However, I like to use some of more of FOV (cg_fov 100), and when I do this, the Weapon HUD still begin to streching.</p>
<p>The maner that I fix this, is changin the values of 3 variables:</p>
<p>cg_gunx,<br>
cg_guny<br>
cg_gunz</p>
<p>Sadly, I don‚Äôt know why, the developers block this variables with the ‚ÄúCheat Protected‚Äù restriction.</p>
<p>In this same way, ioquake (Spearmint too), blocks a newer variables that correspond with the graphics part, I mean:</p>
<p>r_forcesun<br>
r_ambientscale</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why the developer block this variables if this variables are really AWESOME!</p>
<p>The only way to play with this variables is through <strong><em>devmap</em></strong> command, but is not the optimus way to probe this engine.</p>
<p>Well, resuming, there‚Äôs a way to unlock the following variables? (compiling a new engine, modifing the current Spearmint engine, etc):</p>
<p><strong>OLD VARIABLES</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Graphics Part</strong></em><br>
seta r_znear<br>
seta r_lodcurveerror</p>
<p><strong><em>HUD Part</em></strong><br>
cg_gunx<br>
cg_guny<br>
cg_gunz</p>
<p><strong>NEWER VARIABLES (ONLY IN SPEARMINT)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Graphics Part</strong></em><br>
r_forcesun<br>
r_ambientscale</p>
<p>Well, I hope that changing this aspect of this engine may be possible.</p>
<p>See ya!</p>

        <p>I think cg_gun[XYZ] are originally/mainly for use with <code>testgun &lt;modename&gt;</code> developer command. Though I don‚Äôt why these are a cheat since cg_drawGun 0 isn‚Äôt a cheat.</p>
<p>r_znear can be used to see through walls. What is your reason for changing it? What do you change it to? iirc I had issues with it clipping Elite Force view weapons when it was set to 5 so it‚Äôs unlikely I can increase the default.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt really know much about <a href="http://etconfig.net/cvars/r_lodcurveerror/">r_lodCurveError</a> so I can‚Äôt guess the logic behind why it‚Äôs a cheat. It‚Äôs not a cheat in Enemy Territory so I‚Äôm guessing there isn‚Äôt a strong reason for keeping it a cheat.</p>
<p>r_forcesun and r_ambientscale OpenGL2 renderer cvars are meant for testing; the map should add shader commands to enable the settings automatically. I don‚Äôt think this is a good idea but that‚Äôs how it is. The OpenGL2 renderer is developed by SmileTheory at ioquake3 so that would be the person to ask about changing it. (I don‚Äôt really want to have Spearmint‚Äôs OpenGL2 renderer deviate from ioquake3 unless necessary for new features I add.)</p>
<p>devmap is the only option for changing cheat cvars without code changes. Explaining how to remove cheat protection doesn‚Äôt really seem like a great idea. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/zipper_mouthae52.png?v=5" title=":zipper_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":zipper_mouth:"></p>
<p>Spearmint Quake 3 does <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/blob/bd6de77a68e1023d3a9024f564f513a001543ab3/code/cgame/cg_weapons.c#L1403">some correction for view weapon position</a> for non-90 FOV but I don‚Äôt know of an exact way to fixing it. It may be possible to improve it. What values do you use for cg_gun[XYZ] cvars with 100 FOV? What resolution do you use?</p>
<p>I‚Äôm just thinking aloud but if a person wants the gun model to look the same regardless of FOV, then it would be better solved by drawing the weapon with a different FOV than the world. It‚Äôs not possible without code changes though and I‚Äôm not sure of the complexity involved.</p>

<p>Thanks for you great reply zturtleman! I apreciate it a lot! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/grinningae52.png?v=5" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"></p>
<p>Well, this are my reasons to want change the cvars mentioned above:</p>
<p><strong><em>Render OpenGL 1 part:</em></strong> In this section I‚Äôll explain what is my intention and a little idea of how can solve it:</p>
<p>r_znear = 4</p>
<p>The default value is 4, and I know that this variable can be used for cheat. But here‚Äôs an example of what happens when you try to correct the Weapon HUD perspective:</p>
<p><strong><em>The r__znear 4 cvar is cutting/droping a part of the weapon model</em></strong><br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="../../uploads/default/original/1X/c0152df31dd0d798eb34552edc6cec5e1ea640ff.jpg" data-download-href="//forum.clover.moe/uploads/default/c0152df31dd0d798eb34552edc6cec5e1ea640ff" title="shot0003.jpg"><img src="../../uploads/default/optimized/1X/c0152df31dd0d798eb34552edc6cec5e1ea640ff_1_690x388.jpg" width="690" height="388"><div class="meta">
<span class="filename">shot0003.jpg</span><span class="informations">1920x1080 613 KB</span><span class="expand"></span>
</div></a></div></p>
<p><strong><em>And here‚Äôs how we can solve with r__znear  1 value</em></strong></p>
<p>The only problem with this aspect, is about of the cheating issue that you mentioned. But, what about of making the r__znear cvar locked between predefined values? (like Quake Live does)</p>
<p>An example of this in Quake Live is the <strong>cg__gunZ</strong> cvar, that only can be changed between <strong>-10</strong> and <strong>0</strong> values.</p>
<p>Well, the next step is explaining the <strong><em>r__lodCurveError</em></strong> cvar, the images has all the information that you need to understand it.</p>
<p>But resuming:</p>
<p>r_lodCurveError = 250</p>
<p>This cvar work in conjunction with <strong><em>r__suvdivisions</em></strong> cvar, and his default value is 4.</p>
<p>The <strong><em>r__lodCurveError</em></strong> cvar controls the LOD of the 3D Map environment (specially for the curved zones).<br>
And the r_suvdivisions cvar controls the amount of poly density of the curved sufaces (applied for the 3D Map too)</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs an very well examples:</p>
<p><strong><em>r__lodCurveError = 250 and r__suvdivisions = 4</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>r__lodCurveError = 2000 and r__suvdivisions = 1</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Render OpenGL 2 part:</em></strong> In this final part, I want to explain the aspect of the graphics tuning. Is annoying to see that this cvars are blocked, because this cvars only controls a brigthness of HUD Weapon model, you can see:</p>
<p>The HUD Weapons are too brigth, but this can be corrected changin the r_ambientscale cvar. Look:</p>
<p><strong><em>r__ambientscale = 0.6</em></strong> Too brigth</p>
<p><strong><em>r__ambientscale = 0.3</em></strong> Correct brigth</p>
<p><strong>Awesome Shadows part:</strong><br>
As you can see, the impressive shadows with <strong><em>r__forcesun = 1</em></strong> are beautiful. Thanks for tell me about the SmileTheory developer, I‚Äôll try to contact with him. But, I think that I can‚Äôt do much, all depends of this guy <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/frowningae52.png?v=5" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>With <strong><em>r__forcesun = 1</em></strong></p>
<p>With <strong><em>r__forcesun = 0</em></strong></p>
<p>Finally, responding about the <strong>Aspect correct wide screen FOV HUD</strong> I can tell you that this work well only with cg__fov = 90.</p>
<p>Changin the cg__fov = 90 parameter causes the Weapon model begin to hidding through bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Weapon HUD with cg__fov = 100; cg__gunz = 0; res = 1920x1080</strong></p>
<p><strong>Weapon HUD with cg__fov = 100; cg__gunz = 2; res = 1920x1080</strong></p>
<p>Resuming, I‚Äôm using the following values:<br>
<strong><em>HUD Part:</em></strong> This values are for almost weapons‚Ä¶<br>
cg_gunx = 0<br>
cg_guny = 2<br>
cg_gunz = 0</p>
<p>For the Lightgun I like to view some of more of the Weapon HUD 3D model like appears in Quake 3 XBOX 360 version, take a Look:</p>
<p>cg_gunx = 1.2<br>
cg_guny = 2<br>
cg_gunz = 0</p>
<p><strong><em>XBOX 360 Lightgun view</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Quake 3 Spearmint Lightgun corrected view</em></strong></p>
<p>I can comment you that I‚Äôm thinking about other engines, I know that Quake 3 are a very old engine, but we can obtain the better ideas from other engines. I mean, for example:</p>
<p>The Serious Engine 2 (for Serious Sam 2), have a FOV cvar too, but I noticed that the weapon always mantain the correct aspect view, no matter what FOV you are using‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Well, I‚Äôm not a programmer, but I think that you say <em>‚ÄúIt would be better solved by drawing the weapon with a different FOV‚Äù</em> so, you are right. The Croteam team solved this problem with this very good idea.</p>
<p>Again, I think that to make this possible, you need to add code‚Ä¶ much code? I fell that yes, and this is not good for a programmer <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/smileae52.png?v=5" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>
<p>However, I‚Äô think that weapon hud model make the personality of a FPS Game. Without this, I feel that game are empty, is not a FPS completely. By this reason I‚Äôdont like games like Penumbra, or Amnesia, because this games hide the hand when open a door, or grep an objet. And in some aspect Quake Live has the same problem, this make that all Weapons HUD appears very small and streched with the intention to make this game more competitive for tournaments (too see more through the screen). But I think that this aspect may be leaved to be controlled by the gamer, and not obligate to gamers accept something that they don‚Äôt like.</p>
<p>If you play Unreal Tournament 3, Overwatch, Paladins, Counter Strike (with Source engine), or any other arena FPS game, the Weapon HUD model look in his correct aspect, size and position.</p>
<p>So, the path that follow Quake Live in this case, are wrong for me, and is why I want to able to play Quake III Arena classic (with Spearmint) in his correct looking way.</p>
<p>Only needs some of effort to achieve this.</p>
<p>Thanks and I‚Äôll apreciate your soon response.<br>
See ya! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/slight_smileae52.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

        <p>Thanks for your feedback. r_lodCurveError cvar is <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/commit/a35e4b55764e479eafe02d967ebb2ec4aad7a400">no longer cheat protected</a> and is <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/commit/8681f9b9e2d284f6a0455a152638c64065af3548">set by Geometry Quality</a> in Q3‚Äôs Graphics menu so people will use it. <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/spearmint/commit/96eb7e8345def2b1cb41e6d79576f5f9f1aa4383">r_forceSun</a> is no longer cheat protected. There is now a <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/commit/e1174e390b2718f2e6288f6cbe0ed39747d99bae">cg_weaponFov cvar</a> that controls the view weapon‚Äôs field of view (defaults to 90, 0 uses value from cg_fov).

        <p>Hello zturtleman!</p>
<p>Nice to see that you‚Äôre still there!<br>
Just a small note: I think the latest changes to the mint-arena code, concerning the weapon fov you guys are talking about, causes the weapon model to be no longer lit correctly.<br>
It‚Äôs easy to test: start any map, roam around an have a look at your currently held weapon. You‚Äôll notice that the weapon model doesn‚Äôt reflect the color/brightness of the lightmap. In other words, the color and brightness of the weapon will always stay the same, regardless if you are in a very dark or bright area.<br>
This is the case at least on my PC, I‚Äôm not sure if this is an issue for you guys as well‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>Oh, I forgot that would affect the lighting. I didn‚Äôt notice in the outside area in q3dm1. Thanks for reporting it.

        <p>Sorry to reopen this topic, but I think the changes concerning the weapon fov still causes a bug. At least I can‚Äôt see the weapon flash dlight in 1st person view anymore. In 3rd person view the dlight while firing a weapon works correct, but not in first person view. Is this caused by: <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/commit/631f796591c3565607a861ddb99c40686d3812b1" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/commit/631f796591c3565607a861ddb99c40686d3812b1</a>?<br>
What do I wrong, can someone try to confirm this, please?</p>

        <p>Yes, you‚Äôre correct. View weapon flash dynamic light doesn‚Äôt affect world and dynamic lights in world don‚Äôt affect view weapon. They are separate scenes now so this is the correct behavior. I had forgotten about it.</p>
<p>I either need to add dynamic lights to a list in CGame and add them to both of the world and view weapon scenes or change the engine so that I can control view weapon FOV with view weapon still being part of the world scene.</p>

        <p>Oh! Both solutions seems no easy task! Tbh, I would not even know where to start in order to fix this issue <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/cold_sweatae52.png?v=5" title=":cold_sweat:" class="emoji" alt=":cold_sweat:"><br>
But I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll choose the right way to fix this! By the way, which one of the above solutions is more suitable to add so called ‚Äòweapon sway‚Äô?<br>
On Quake 3 World someone asked for it, and he is true. Weapon sway was never implemented with idtech3, afaik! Yes, yes TF is Source engine, and Source is Quake etc.,‚Ä¶ but I mean, for the Q series I only know Q1 mods and Q2 (Berserker) and everything beyond Q3 has at least one released mod with swaying view weapons, but not Q3.<br>
Here is what is meant: <a href="http://www.quake3world.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=50784" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.quake3world.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=16&amp;t=50784</a></p>
<p>So, is there any solution of the two solutions you mentioned, that would make implementing weapon sway easier for modders?<br>
And, wouldn‚Äôt weapon sway fit for Mint-Games? The best idtech3 game, with Mint-Arena to be the first idtech3  game with weapon-sway?</p>
<p>Well, sorry, I don‚Äôt know much about ‚Äòview weapon code‚Äô eventually weapon-sway is a bit off-topic, anyways, whats your thoughts?</p>

        <p>Hi there!<br>
Sorry for the late, I‚Äôve some problems in my personal life, but now I‚Äôm fine.</p>
<p>So, let‚Äôs continue with this incredible engine.<br>
Here‚Äôs all the pics that complement all that I say in this post, take a look:<br>
<a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!AkWq1oczfEQG8hMsmPVKKsXmAZpT" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://1drv.ms/f/s!AkWq1oczfEQG8hMsmPVKKsXmAZpT</a></p>
<p>I‚Äôve have done a little research and I‚Äôve found some little things to be revised.</p>
<p>Take a look:</p>
<p><strong>Antialiasing with OpenGL 2 mode doesn‚Äôt work</strong><br>
When I turn OpenGL 2 mode, the AA filter doesn‚Äôt apply to the weapon model, neither to the head model of the HUD. I think that all the 3D objets from the HUD needs to be revised. I‚Äôve already readed the discover from <strong>KuehnhamTobias</strong> about the LIT for the Weapon HUD. And I think that the AA effect correspond to the same aspect in some way.<br>
So, modifying some part of the engine, causes that the other problems appears, ha!<br>
But I want to say that I‚Äôm glad to help, research and contribute with this incredibly engine. Sincerely.</p>
<p><strong>The translucents skyboxes in OpenGL 2 and Z-Buffer fight light problem into the mirror of Q3DM0</strong><br>
Well, while played this great modified idtech3 engine, I‚Äôve noticed that in some maps, appears a slightly line that follows my movements‚Ä¶</p>
<p>So, after some time vieweing like a impressed cat following a lasser light, I‚Äôve founded that‚Äôs the skybox map! You can see the translucent skybox in the <strong>0:12 min</strong>, and the <strong>1:32 min</strong>.</p>
<p>The other aspect viewed in the video is an extrange <em>Z-Buffer Fight</em> with the lights into the mirror in Q3DM0 map (<em><strong>The Introduction</strong></em> Map). You can see in the min <strong>0:40</strong>, when I move the X axis, the lights into the mirror are cutted. I think that light work like a 2D sprite billboard from Doom. But correctme if I‚Äôm wrong.</p>
<p>I think that this little things contribute the FPS drops (I suspect, I‚Äôm not sure).</p>

<p><strong>Team Arena Main Menu is not work now</strong><br>
With this change (from the Weapon HUD spearmint-0.4-20170215.zip) the support for Team Arena Main Menu was lost.<br>
So, there is, another little bug to fix. <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/grinae52.png?v=5" title=":grin:" class="emoji" alt=":grin:"></p>
<p><strong>2k and 4k ressolutions don‚Äôt downsampling into the monitor</strong><br>
Well, I‚Äôve a Radeon RX470 video card, and this let me to create Virtual Super Resolutions like 2k (2560x1440) and 4k (3840x2160). Many games run it without problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>STALKER</li>
<li>Paladins</li>
<li>GZDoom</li>
<li>Etc</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Vanilla Quake 3, and Spearmint, don‚Äôt fit (downsample) the scale of these resolutions causing the screen oversising. Watch the following video:</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="l34_AEAOjv0" data-youtube-title="Quake III Spearmint 4K downsampling test" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>Well, this is all the bugs that I founded.<br>
I hope that help to make this engine, a better engine.</p>
<p>Thanks zturtleman, thanks KuehnhammerTobias.</p>
<p>See ya! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/sunglassesae52.png?v=5" title=":sunglasses:" class="emoji" alt=":sunglasses:"></p>

        <p>Hi SolivaN!</p>
<p>Glad you‚Äôre still there and you are fine!</p>
<p>Just a few quick things that came into my mind while I was reading your ‚Äúbug report‚Äù:</p>
<ol>
<li>Unfortunately it‚Äôs hard to see the effect of <em>‚Äúappears a slightly line that follows my movements‚Ä¶‚Äù</em> on the videos (they are a bit blurry). Probably you see the seam of the cube maps, you can try to get rid of this seam by enabling seamless cube maps (go to a place where you see the line, bring down the console, set your <strong>r_arb_seamless_cube_map</strong> cvar to 1, do a <strong>vid_restart</strong> and see if the line will vanish)‚Ä¶ in the past I saw this line also before I switched the cvar!</li>
<li>About the 2560x1440 resolution, well, it works on my system, so I‚Äôm in doubt it‚Äôs only game related, even if other games run fine in 2560x1440 on your computer‚Ä¶ eventually try to set the width and height manually (the cvars are called <strong>r_customwidth/r_customheight</strong> followed by the value for your monitors resolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Well, as already said I‚Äôm not sure if this well help, but it would be interesting if this will help you.<br>
I didn‚Äôt check the things you mentioned in detail at the moment. I‚Äôm no expert!</p>
<p>For the OpenGL2 renderer in common:<br>
mirrors do still have more bugs, check q3dm8 with r_forceSun enabled, the sun light is shining through the ceiling mirror‚Ä¶<br>
zturtleman added a lot of incredible amazing things to the renderer(s), TrueType font Support, rain and snow atmospheric effects, enhanced sky/water fog, corona entities and whatnot, but all in all the OpenGL2 renderer is made by another author that ripped out parts from Xreal renderer (made by Robert Beckebans).<br>
Most (not to say all) bugs concerning the renders aren‚Äôt introduced by zturtleman. As far as I know only the tone effect doesn‚Äôt work well with splitscreen mode‚Ä¶<br>
Also lightning/shadowing is broken but not by Spearmint. For some lightning bugs a fix is already there (without the need of rewriting all the shaders). Check this: <a href="https://bugzilla.icculus.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6058" rel="nofollow noopener">https://bugzilla.icculus.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6058</a>. I don‚Äôt understand the goal/policy of ioquake3 authors anymore and why they don‚Äôt fix things a bugfix is already available for. So you have to apply them for yourself (coding skills are needed)‚Ä¶if you are interestend in fixing the renderer.<br>
What I want to say is, that as far as I know all the rendering bugs you‚Äôll find, will also be seen with ioquake3!</p>
<p>I hope we will hear more from you, and your problems will be solved, especially the 2k/4k resolution problem seems serious to me‚Ä¶I never heard of this problem! Btw, what is your monitor manufacturer/type?</p>
<p>EDIT: Sometimes I can‚Äôt even find my own things, but here we are, concerning the mirrors, I think the problem is somehow related to framebuffer multisampling. I made an issue ticket here: <a href="https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3/issues/121" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/ioquake/ioq3/issues/121</a> Though, I didn‚Äôt find a fix for it ever, and I‚Äôm not even sure if the flares are the problem or the mirrors! Or if both issues related at all!<br>
Merde, this world needs some good (open source) rendering experts too!</p>

        <p>Hahaha, sure! This world of opensource needs a lot of work. But with the help from us, we can apport a little bit more with this hard work.</p>
<p>So, all the tips that you say I‚Äôll try when arrive at my home.</p>
<p>The skybox problem can be seen turning the Full HD mode in youtube. So don‚Äôt forget to watch the videos in Full HD mode.</p>
<p>The other way to see the slightly line is viewing the screenshots that I made. So, take a look too.</p>
<p>In the other hand we have the downsampling problem. I think that this limitation/bug are inherit from vanilla q3 engine.<br>
So, is a good time to fix this. I think so.</p>
<p>My monitor is a common Samsung Syncmaster S23B370 of 23" inch, with a max res of 1920x1080.<br>
However, the problem is not in the monitor neither the video card. Like a say recently, other games like STALKER, Paladins, etc can downsampling perfectly on my monitor.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll try the r_customwidth and r_customheight and I‚Äôll comment you.</p>
<p>So, thanks for your comments and reply.</p>
<p>See ya soon!</p>

        <p>Wow! the <strong>r_arb_seamless_cube_map</strong> cvar work flawlessly! It has been corrected the the seam of the cube maps (or the edge of the skyboxes? are the same?)</p>
<p>Well, I‚Äôve tested the <strong>r_customwidth/r_customheight</strong>, with <strong>r_mode -1</strong>, but the same problem happens.</p>

        <p>Nice to hear that r_arb_seamless_cube_map did solve your problem! <img src="../../images/emoji/twitter/relaxedae52.png?v=5" title=":relaxed:" class="emoji" alt=":relaxed:"></p>
<p>About the Team Arena menu, what exactly did not work for you? I try do as much as possible in mint-arena‚Äôs Team Arena menu and I can‚Äôt find anything that didn‚Äôt work, or behave differently than before. I mean does the menu not appear/start or is there something you can‚Äôt click with your mouse anymore, or  are there any graphical glitches?</p>
<p>And about the 2k/4k problem: just to make it clear, even 2560x1440 doesn‚Äôt work correct? Or does only 3840x2160 resulting in the bug your video is showing? Unfortunately atm nobody I know has a monitor with a native resolution of about 3840x2160 (just to check how it should look like). On everything below that resolution (2560x1440, 1920x1080 etc.) Spearmint behaves correct for us. Thats why I‚Äôm asking if the bug you are showing is only on 3840x2160 settings or even with lower values?<br>
Hopefully I can have access to a Dell 4k this weekend, though I‚Äôm not sure if this will help us.<br>
Maybe zturtleman knows more about 4k resolutions? OTOH 4k gaming is still rare I think, I don‚Äôt really know many people with 4k experience‚Ä¶</p>

        <p>Is the Team Arena menu issue that I did not include Team Arena (missionpack) files in the test builds I posted in this thread?</p>
<p>The render and display size are not set separately. Using a resolution large than the monitor will not fit on the screen. This is regular OpenGL behavior.</p>
<p>I would like to separate them eventually by rendering to a frame buffer and then scaling to window size. Primarily for fullscreen desktop support where fullscreen mode is just a window the size of the screen without changing the system video mode to the game resolution. I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll get around to adding it though.</p>

        <p>Hi KuehnhammerTobias!</p>
<p>The Team Arena Menu don‚Äôt appears, that‚Äôs it simply, only appears the default Q3 Arena menu, with only the menu sound effects from TA.</p>
<p>Yea, the 2k an 4k res don‚Äôt work. I don‚Äôt know how it work well on your system. The OpenGL games seems have this problems frecuently. I‚Äôve seen the same problem on Heretic II, Hexen II, Quake Live, etc (Except Doom 4).</p>
<p>The case of Doom 4 are different, because this uses Vulkan render. I suppose that Vulkan are similar to DirectX render in the support of downsampling.</p>
<p>I want to try Doom 4 in OpenGL 4.2 mode and I‚Äôll comment you at respect.</p>
<p>So, I think that is a general problem of older OpenGL renders (from OpenGL 1.1 to OpenGL 2.1 I think)</p>
<p>The OpenGL 3.0 to the actually OpenGL 4.5 I think have solved this problem. I don‚Äôt made a tests yet with differents versions of OpenGL. But is a thing that I want to made soon.</p>
