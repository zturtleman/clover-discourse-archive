    <title>Currently implementing the Q3 demotest UI (along with the load/save config menus)</title>
    <link>https://forum.clover.moe/t/currently-implementing-the-q3-demotest-ui-along-with-the-load-save-config-menus/60</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve got the cvar already ready, it&#39;s called &quot;ui_demoq3test&quot; &amp; it will include the menu text featured in the demotest as well as the load/save config menus. Otherwise, it will function similarly to the demo. Also, an option to load the demo ending cutscene was also implemented. I know other things need to be done before it will look exactly like the original, but I think this may help make it take shape cosmetically &amp; functionally. Just how are you supposed to make menu options disappear using a cvar anyway? Mind helping me out here anyone?</description>

              <p>Anyone tested this work on my repo yet? Did you test it a little, <a class="mention" href="/u/kuehnhammertobias">@KuehnhammerTobias</a>? I don’t want to infect my Spearmint with stuff like this just yet, that’s why I’ve released the repo.</p>

I hope it’s going okay so far. I may have missed a few files but I’m getting there. The demotest blurb should also be showing OK now as well. Hopefully load/save config menus work fine in the demo test as well.</p>

              <p>Hmm. Thank you, I’ll upload my modified files onto a branch which will be used for a pull request. Don’t make ANY commits until this is done. Onto the baseq3 UI at least.</p>
