    <title>Quake 3 Revolution player skins</title>
    <link>https://forum.clover.moe/t/quake-3-revolution-player-skins/45</link>
    <description>I just figured out that someone ported the skins from Q3R over to Q3A. Yes, even the unused Hunter skins, although I think they&#39;re fixable, some of them (the Freeman &amp; Warrior Hunter skins) are pretty much unusable in the state they&#39;re in. They both need their head textures redone, but everything else is in there (Hunter&#39;s Q3R default skin suffered the same fate as the Freeman skin). :sob: Why did they have to commit this torture on these awesome skins? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY????????????????????
