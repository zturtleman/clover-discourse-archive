    <title>Camera adhesion/Aim assist for controllers?</title>
    <link>https://forum.clover.moe/t/camera-adhesion-aim-assist-for-controllers/91</link>
    <description>Hello! I&#39;m checking out Spearmint Q3A as an option for a splitscreen LAN party thingy. I intend to pitch this game as something to play instead of our usual fallback, Halo: Reach, but something that has me concerned is the lack of camera adhesion or aim assist for controllers, as I don&#39;t think my friends would be willing to play without that crutch. Is there a way to enable it, even if it is something of a weird hack? Thanks in advance!</description>
