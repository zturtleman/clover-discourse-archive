    <description>I&#39;ve been wondering if Zack&#39;s still going to continue development of Spearmint. I haven&#39;t seen any development news since July. Is 0.5 still going as planned?</description>

              <p>I haven’t worked on Spearmint since version 0.4 was released. I’m kind of burned out and tired of working on it. There are other things I want to do and I should focus on life a little more. I’m taking a break from Spearmint for now.</p>
