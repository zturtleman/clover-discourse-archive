          <title>Technical question about VOTE string</title>

              <p>Hello everyone who read this!</p>
<p>My question is concerning something I consider as a bug in idtech3, though I’m not 100% sure if it is a bug at all!</p>
<p><strong>THE</strong> (possible) <strong>BUG:</strong><br>
In some specific situations the VOTE string (most notably with Team Arena mod) don’t vanish. The text/string will stay on screen until a new map restart. This happens if more than one vote is called. For example you vote for a new map, and realize you voted for the wrong map and will vote again for the correct map you was looking for.<br>
It seems as if the vote commands are added in a vote queue, but I never saw that the vote system is working like this, maybe I missed something here…</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO REPRODUCE:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Start Team Arena mod (either via Spearmint or ioquake3).</li>
<li>Start any map e.g.: q3dm1.</li>
<li>Now open the VOTE menu and vote for a new/different map (e.g.: q3dm2).</li>
<li>The menu will close, immediatly before the new map will restart bring down the VOTE menu again and vote for another different map (e.g.: q3dm3).</li>
<li>Now the first map voted for will start and the Vote string: <em>Vote: Yes: 0, No: 0. Press F1 to vote for Yes or F2 to vote for No (or press ESC then click Vote).</em> will appear on screen.</li>
<li>No matter what you do, the vote string will not disappear, as long as a new map restart will happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now my <strong>QUESTIONS</strong> are:<br>
A: Is this a common idtech3 bug, or is this behaviour intentionally?<br>
B: Personally I find this behaviour annoying, does someone know how to fix this, even if it isn’t a bug at all?</p>
<p>All suggestions and every information is welcome!<br>
Thank you!</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Well, I’ve tested this engine and this is the most flawessly that all others source ports (Berserker 3, iouake 3, OpenArena, etc).</p>
<p>Finally, a source port that correct’s the <strong>Aspect correct wide screen FOV and HUD in Q3A!</strong></p>
<p>However, I like to use some of more of FOV (cg_fov 100), and when I do this, the Weapon HUD still begin to streching.</p>
<p>The maner that I fix this, is changin the values of 3 variables:</p>
<p>cg_gunx,<br>
cg_guny<br>
cg_gunz</p>
<p>Sadly, I don’t know why, the developers block this variables with the “Cheat Protected” restriction.</p>
<p>In this same way, ioquake (Spearmint too), blocks a newer variables that correspond with the graphics part, I mean:</p>
<p>r_forcesun<br>
r_ambientscale</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why the developer block this variables if this variables are really AWESOME!</p>
<p>The only way to play with this variables is through <strong><em>devmap</em></strong> command, but is not the optimus way to probe this engine.</p>
<p>Well, resuming, there’s a way to unlock the following variables? (compiling a new engine, modifing the current Spearmint engine, etc):</p>
<p><strong>OLD VARIABLES</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Graphics Part</strong></em><br>
seta r_znear<br>
seta r_lodcurveerror</p>
<p><strong><em>HUD Part</em></strong><br>
cg_gunx<br>
cg_guny<br>
cg_gunz</p>
<p><strong>NEWER VARIABLES (ONLY IN SPEARMINT)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Graphics Part</strong></em><br>
r_forcesun<br>
r_ambientscale</p>
<p>Well, I hope that changing this aspect of this engine may be possible.</p>
<p>See ya!</p>

              <p>Hello! I’m checking out Spearmint Q3A as an option for a splitscreen LAN party thingy. I intend to pitch this game as something to play instead of our usual fallback, Halo: Reach, but something that has me concerned is the lack of camera adhesion or aim assist for controllers, as I don’t think my friends would be willing to play without that crutch. Is there a way to enable it, even if it is something of a weird hack? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>For thoose who wonder why to use Discord I’ll say that it’s runs so fast! Skype is full of ads, lags, spy things.<br>
Currently soon screensharing will be added in Discord, but what I wait it’s VIDEO call, so it beat skype out completely.<br>
Well, just check the official site of Discord. And it’s crossplatform.</p>

              <p>I’ve got the cvar already ready, it’s called “ui_demoq3test” &amp; it will include the menu text featured in the demotest as well as the load/save config menus. Otherwise, it will function similarly to the demo. Also, an option to load the demo ending cutscene was also implemented. I know other things need to be done before it will look exactly like the original, but I think this may help make it take shape cosmetically &amp; functionally. Just how are you supposed to make menu options disappear using a cvar anyway? Mind helping me out here anyone?</p>

              <p>I ported the botlib (except the C preprocessor which is also used by Team Arena CGame/UI) into the Game VM. This required the ability to free memory, which was added in Spearmint devil branch and released in Spearmint 0.4. See <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/tree/botlib">botlib branch</a>.</p>
<p>I’m planning to move files I had previously ported to Game VM back into the botlib. The main reason I’m holding off merging it into master branch is because BSPC requires parts of the botlib in the engine.</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/tree/botlib">bspc branch</a> with it ported to mint-arena based on the botlib branch but it require a bunch of engine code, including BSP and ZIP loading and the C preprocessor, to be duplicated. <img src="//forum.clover.moe/images/emoji/twitter/weary.png?v=5" title=":weary:" class="emoji" alt=":weary:"></p>
<p>So I’m still working through how to handle this, but it will happen eventually.</p>

              <p>This bug exists in ioq3 &amp; classic Q3 as well. The bug is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start a TDM on any map (I used q3dm7)</li>
<li>Have at least one person on both teams (I tested with at least 4 bots on Blue &amp; 1 on Red)</li>
<li>Have everyone on your team kill the only bot on Red (might also happen with just one teammate, untested however)</li>
<li>If you didn’t give these teammates a new order, after a while, “ERROR: PlayerName: player name out of range” or similar will occur. Bug happens on Q3 1.32c &amp; possibly even the original source code has this bug. Unknown if the bug happens on earlier versions of Q3. Mind fixing this (&amp; the stuck in RA room q3dm7 issue) before Spearmint 0.4 if possible <a class="mention" href="/u/zturtleman">@zturtleman</a>? Thanks in advance.</li>

<p>I’m tried of waiting for August to get here. I’d like to just do the release and move on. Also, ioq3 merged a pull request that removes Mac OS X 10.5 and 10.6 support, which I don’t want to merge into Spearmint right now or deal with “fixing it”.</p>
<p>I’m planning to release a new version of Turtle Arena in August. That’s the only reason Spearmint 0.4 got moved from January 13 2017 (a Friday the 13th) to August 13 2016. Moving Spearmint to July might also make it easier to focus on Turtle Arena.</p>

The texture used for the eye shader still exists among the game files (braneye.tga to be exact). Also, Brandon’s hat had a shader as well, most likely to have his hat glow (Spearmint uses a dummy texture, but I think a custom texture made out of braneye should allow the shader to actually work).</p>

              <p>Maybe it’s a silly question, but to be honest, I don’t understand the configstrings in detail, so here is the question, well actually there are three questions:</p>
<p><strong>Q1: Does the name length of shaders, sounds, maps count to the total size of a configstring?</strong><br>
I was never worried when I created some assets for idtech3 games. After I read an article on ET Legacy’s wiki, I am a bit confused about the lenght of configstring sizes. Here is the article: <a href="https://dev.etlegacy.com/projects/etlegacy/wiki/Mapping_and_Textures#Configstrings-or-the-configstring#L144" rel="nofollow noopener">Configstrings or the configstring</a></p>
<p><strong>Q2: Does name length of e.g.: sounds only be a problem for map (speaker) and ‘scripted’ sounds or is the length of the name also important for ‘hardcoded’ sounds, e.g.: the weapon firing sounds etc.</strong><br>
Probably only assets are meant that are related to ET’s Scripting system?</p>
<p><strong>Q3: If the name lenght of assets matters. Is this only the case for ET Legacy or for all idtech3 games.</strong><br>
I wonder if this configstring issue is also true for Spearmint, does it make sense for standalone games to name all the assets as short as possible then? Sounds, shaders, textures, and even map names?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>

              <p>I’m perplexed as to why this bot’s chatfile isn’t working. It’s a bot I’m making for a port of the Santa model from QL to Q3A. It’d be fun to see him rock &amp; roll. [offtopic] And P.S. the bots on bot_challenge 1 are almost impossible to beat! Jeezus they’re hard![/offtopic]<br>

              <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have both Q3A and Team Arena on Steam. Q3 has all the pk3 required for spearmint to run (0-8) but my missionpack folder only has pak0.pk3, and the readme says it needs 0-4. Team Arena works fine native from Steam, though.</p>
<p>Where can I get those missing pk3 files?</p>

              <p>I just figured out that someone ported the skins from Q3R over to Q3A. Yes, even the unused Hunter skins, although I think they’re fixable, some of them (the Freeman &amp; Warrior Hunter skins) are pretty much unusable in the state they’re in. They both need their head textures redone, but everything else is in there (Hunter’s Q3R default skin suffered the same fate as the Freeman skin). <img src="//forum.clover.moe/images/emoji/twitter/sob.png?v=5" title=":sob:" class="emoji" alt=":sob:"> Why did they have to commit this torture on these awesome skins?

              <p>I was wanting to use it because I wanted to make a green team mod &amp; a new 3-way CTF gametype for it, but it turns out quite a bit of g_team.c &amp; ai_team.c would have to be rewritten because of this…<br>
Currently, the only 2 possible values for the friendly/enemy team would be TEAM_RED &amp; TEAM_BLUE, I would like those to be TEAM_FRIENDLY, TEAM_ENEMY1, &amp; TEAM_ENEMY2 for this gametype to be possible… Those values should be wildcards, and should be controlled by which teams are in the map, for ex. Blue &amp; Red are at it again in 2-way CTF, TEAM_FRIENDLY would be the team that the bots/humans are on (on the Blue Team’s case, it would be TEAM_BLUE, &amp; for the Red Team, it would be TEAM_RED. TEAM_ENEMY1 would be the opposite team (opposite values than TEAM_FRIENDLY), &amp; TEAM_ENEMY2 would be set to no team, since there’s only 2 teams in that CTF. This configuration would allow you to select more than the blue/red team in 2-team CTF, &amp; all 3 teams in 3-team CTF. I know what you’re thinking <a class="mention" href="/u/zturtleman">@zturtleman</a>, it’s a bit unorthodox to have 3 teams in CTF, isn’t it? TEAM_FRIENDLY would in this case depend on whichever team you selected/whatever bots were selected to go there. Same with TEAM_ENEMY1 &amp; TEAM_ENEMY2. Gameplay’s the same, except this time, there are 2 enemies of your team instead of one, &amp; if you grab both teams’ flags, you earn 2 captures for your team because you captured 2 flags.<br>
Green team is possible because there is a green team skin pk3 which is downloadable via <a href="http://ws.q3df.org" rel="nofollow noopener">ws.q3df.org</a>.<br>
Hope I’m not tiring you out, <a class="mention" href="/u/zturtleman">@zturtleman</a>…</p>
